    <H3> Making this Webpage</H3>
    <H4> For this assignment I largely focused on coding the aesthetics of 
        the webpage. I added a border to the title of the webpage as well as
        added color and changed the font. I utilized CHAT GPT to find code 
        that would allow me to align headings in the center.  
        Below the initial heading tag I added another heading tag that 
        briefly describes what users will be exploring throughout my webpage.
        Finally I closed the heading by adding a short description of all the 
        changes made on the webpage. The body of the webpage consists of three
         different images. </H4>
