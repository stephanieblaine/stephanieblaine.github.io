    <p id="explanation">This supernova shock wave plows through interstellar space at over 500,000 kilometers per hour. Centered and moving upward in the sharply detailed color composite its thin, bright, braided filaments are actually long ripples in a cosmic sheet of glowing gas seen almost edge-on. Discovered in the 1840s by Sir John Herschel, the narrow-looking nebula is sometimes known as Herschel's Ray. Cataloged as NGC 2736, its pointed appearance suggests its modern popular name, the Pencil Nebula. The Pencil Nebula is about 800 light-years away. Nearly 5 light-years long it represents only a small part of the Vela supernova remnant though. The enormous Vela remnant itself is around 100 light-years in diameter, the expanding debris cloud of a star that was seen to explode about 11,000 years ago. Initially, the section of the shock wave seen as the Pencil nebula was moving at millions of kilometers per hour but has slowed considerably, sweeping up surrounding interstellar material.</p>

    <H3> Making this Webpage</H3>
    <H4> For this assignment I largely focused on coding the aesthetics of 
        the webpage. I added a border to the title of the webpage as well as
        added color and changed the font. I utilized CHAT GPT to find code 
        that would allow me to align headings in the center.  
        Below the initial heading tag I added another heading tag that 
        briefly describes what users will be exploring throughout my webpage.
        Finally I closed the heading by adding a short description of all the 
        changes made on the webpage. The body of the webpage consists of three
         different images. </H4>
